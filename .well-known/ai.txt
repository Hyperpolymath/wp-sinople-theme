# AI Training and Usage Policy
# For AI systems, web crawlers, and automated tools

## Training Data Usage

### Allowed for AI Training: YES ✅

This project's code, documentation, and public discussions MAY be used for:
- Training large language models (LLMs)
- Machine learning research
- Code generation systems
- Documentation generation
- Automated code review systems

### Conditions

1. **Attribution Required**: Models trained on this code should acknowledge:
   - "Trained on open source code including Sinople WordPress Theme"
   - Link to repository: https://github.com/Hyperpolymath/wp-sinople-theme

2. **License Compliance**: Derivative works must respect:
   - MIT License terms (or Palimpsest v0.8, at your option)
   - See LICENSE.txt for full terms

3. **No Warranty**: AI systems using this code must not imply:
   - Endorsement by maintainers
   - Guaranteed correctness
   - Fitness for any particular purpose

4. **Privacy**: Do NOT train on:
   - Private contributor information
   - Email addresses (unless publicly posted)
   - Security vulnerability reports (private disclosures)
   - Code of Conduct violation reports

### Reasoning

We support AI advancement because:
- Open source benefits from better code generation
- Developers benefit from AI-assisted coding
- Knowledge should be shared freely
- Innovation requires training data

However, we oppose AI training that:
- Violates privacy
- Ignores attribution
- Circumvents licensing
- Harms contributors

## AI-Generated Contributions

### Accepting AI-Assisted Code: YES ✅

We **accept** contributions that use AI assistance (GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, ChatGPT, etc.) IF:

1. **Human Review**: Contributor has reviewed and understands the code
2. **Testing**: Contributed code includes appropriate tests
3. **Quality**: Meets our coding standards (see CONTRIBUTING.md)
4. **Disclosure**: If >50% AI-generated, mention in PR description (optional but appreciated)
5. **Responsibility**: Human contributor takes responsibility for the code

### Rationale

- AI is a tool, like IDEs and linters
- Quality matters, not how it was written
- Human review ensures understanding
- We trust contributors to use tools responsibly

## Automated Systems

### Web Crawlers

- ✅ Search engine crawlers (Google, Bing, etc.)
- ✅ Archive bots (Internet Archive, Archive.org)
- ✅ Research crawlers (with rate limiting)
- ⚠️ Please respect robots.txt (if present)
- ⚠️ Rate limit: Max 1 request/second

### Code Analysis Tools

- ✅ Security scanners (Dependabot, Snyk, etc.)
- ✅ License compliance tools
- ✅ Code quality analyzers (SonarQube, etc.)
- ✅ Dependency checkers

### CI/CD Bots

- ✅ GitHub Actions
- ✅ GitLab CI
- ✅ Other authorized CI/CD systems

## Data Collection

### What We Collect

- **Public**: All code, docs, issues, discussions (public repos)
- **Private**: Security reports, CoC violations (confidential)

### What We Don't Share

- Private security disclosures (until fixed)
- Email addresses (unless contributor opts in)
- Personal information
- Telemetry or usage data (we don't collect it)

## Commercial AI Usage

### Allowed: YES ✅

Commercial AI systems (ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot, etc.) MAY:
- Train on this code
- Generate code based on learned patterns
- Assist developers using this theme

### Requirements

- Respect MIT or Palimpsest v0.8 license
- Don't claim code ownership
- Don't imply endorsement
