PREAMBLE

This license embodies the principle that software should be free to use,
modify, and distribute, while respecting the autonomy and safety of all
contributors and users, regardless of political context.

The term "Palimpsest" reflects that software evolves through layers of
contribution, each building on what came before, creating a rich history
that should be preserved and honored.

RATIONALE

The Palimpsest License exists because:

1. Software development transcends political boundaries
2. Contributors deserve safety regardless of geopolitical changes
3. Attribution should honor history while protecting individuals
4. Political neutrality enables universal access and contribution
5. Open source should be truly open to all humans

This license enables cooperation across political divides while protecting
individual contributors from political retribution or forced association.
